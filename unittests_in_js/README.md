## Description

This project focuses on learning and applying unit testing techniques in JavaScript using tools like Mocha, Chai, Sinon, and others. You will explore writing test suites, using assertion libraries, and testing Node.js applications, both synchronously and asynchronously. By the end, youâ€™ll be able to confidently test small node servers with integration tests.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

1. Use **Mocha** to write a comprehensive test suite.
2. Utilize different assertion libraries like **Node assertions** or **Chai**.
3. Present and organize long test suites effectively.
4. Identify when and how to use **spies** and **stubs**.
5. Understand and implement **hooks** in your test setup.
6. Perform unit testing with asynchronous functions.
7. Write integration tests for small Node.js servers.

## Requirements

To ensure your project meets expectations:

- Your code will be executed on **Ubuntu 20.04** using **Node.js 20.x.x**.
- Use any of these editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`, or **Visual Studio Code**.
- All files must end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file is mandatory at the root of the project directory.
- Use the `.js` file extension for your code.
- Ensure that all tests pass correctly without warnings or errors when running:
