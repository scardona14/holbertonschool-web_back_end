# Queuing System in JS

## Description

This project explores the implementation of a queuing system in JavaScript using Redis and Kue. You'll learn how to set up and interact with a Redis server, handle async operations, and integrate a Redis-backed queue system into a basic Express app.

## Resources

Here are some resources to help you succeed in this project:

- [Redis quick start](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/)
- [Redis client interface](https://redis.io/docs/ui/cli/)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

1. Run a Redis server on your machine.
2. Perform basic operations with the Redis client.
3. Use a Redis client with Node.js for basic operations.
4. Store hash values in Redis.
5. Handle async operations with Redis.
6. Use Kue as a queue system.
7. Build a basic Express app interacting with a Redis server.
8. Build an Express app interacting with both a Redis server and a queue system.
