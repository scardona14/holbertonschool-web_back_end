# Internationalization (i18n) with Flask

This project focuses on implementing internationalization (i18n) in a Flask application. By the end of this project, you will have learned how to handle multiple languages in a Flask app, infer user locales, and localize timestamps.

## Project Overview

### Description

In this project, youâ€™ll implement i18n features for a Flask application by:
- Displaying different languages based on user preferences or request headers
- Localizing timestamps to ensure they are displayed correctly based on user timezone

### Learning Objectives
- Understand how to parametrize Flask templates to display different languages
- Learn to infer the correct locale using URL parameters, user settings, or request headers
- Localize timestamps based on user timezone information

## Requirements

- All files are interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **Python 3.9**
- Each file must end with a new line
- `README.md` at the root of the project directory is mandatory
- Code should adhere to **pycodestyle** standards (version 2.5)
- All Python files should start with the line `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- All `.py` files must be executable
- Modules, classes, functions, and methods must have clear, descriptive documentation
  - Example: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
  - Documentation should be a full sentence explaining the purpose
- All functions and coroutines must have type annotations
