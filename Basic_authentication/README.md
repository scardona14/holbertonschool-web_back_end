# Basic Authentication

## Description

In this project, you will learn what the authentication process means and implement a **Basic Authentication** on a simple API.

> In the industry, you should **not** implement your own Basic authentication system. Instead, use a module or framework that does it for you (e.g., Python-Flask: `Flask-HTTPAuth`). However, for the purpose of learning, we will walk through each step of this mechanism to understand it by doing.

## Resources

Here are some resources to help you understand the concepts covered in this project:

- [REST API Authentication Mechanisms](https://example.com)
- [Base64 in Python](https://example.com)
- [HTTP header Authorization](https://example.com)
- [Flask](https://example.com)
- [Base64 - concept](https://example.com)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts to anyone without needing to consult external sources:

### General Concepts:
- What authentication means
- What Base64 is
- How to encode a string in Base64
- What Basic Authentication means
- How to send the Authorization header

## Requirements

### Python Scripts:
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using **python3** (version 3.9).
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your Python scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
- Code should follow the **pycodestyle** style (version 2.5).
- All files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

### Documentation:
- All modules should have documentation, testable with:  
  `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
- All classes should have documentation, testable with:  
  `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`
- All functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation, testable with:  
  `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`  
  `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`
- A proper documentation is more than a single wordâ€”it must be a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method. Documentation length will be verified.
